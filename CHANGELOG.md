- Professional documentation and examples

### Changed
- Improved spatial indexing performance with smart fallback strategies
- Updated API documentation with comprehensive examples
- Simplified repository structure and removed outdated files

### Fixed
- Spatial indexing now correctly finds nearby points across different geohash regions
- Linter warnings resolved across all modules
